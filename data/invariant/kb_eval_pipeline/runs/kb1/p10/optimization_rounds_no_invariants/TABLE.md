# GEMM Optimization History

This file is shared state between optimization rounds.
The orchestrator rewrites the history section after each round while preserving this intro.

Interpretation rules for the agent:
- Treat the recorded outcomes as the authoritative history of what has already been tried.
- Avoid repeating a failed optimization unless the new round has a clearly different reason to retry it.
- Prefer incremental decisions that build on the previous round instead of restarting from scratch.
